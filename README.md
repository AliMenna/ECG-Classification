Heartbeat Recognition from ECG

This project focuses on heartbeat classification from ECG signals, using machine learning techniques applied to the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.  
The goal is to automatically recognize different types of heartbeats from raw ECG data.

This work was developed as an academic project.

Workflow

1. Data Loading
   - Load ECG signals and annotations
2. Preprocessing
   - Balancing dataset
   - Noise reduction (if applicable)
   - Normalization
3. Model Training
   - Supervised classification model (Customized CNN)
4. Evaluation
   - Accuracy and performance analysis on test data


Machine Learning Model
